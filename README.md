## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on [blueapi](https://github.com/DiamondLightSource/blueapi): Diamond Light Source's bluesky-as-a-service and replacement for the GDA server; [ophyd-async](https://github.com/bluesky/ophyd-async): a modern implementation of the bluesky device abstraction layer; and [ways of deploying the "Athena" stack to beamlines](https://github.com/epics-containers/p45-deployment) and other infrastructure concerns (authn/authz/monitoring & traceability/data access, integrity & packaging...).
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Rust and people-management skills.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on NeXus data-writing, adding new device classes, 
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: reach out to [Joseph Ware @ the bluesky mattermost](https://blueskyproject.io/mattermost/) or start [a discussion on this repository](https://github.com/DiamondJoseph/DiamondJoseph/discussions): if it's not bluesky related we can find a more appropriate method.
